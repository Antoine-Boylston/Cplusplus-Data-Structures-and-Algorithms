üìå What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

This course had two major projects set in the context of a scenario: I was tasked with building software for ABC University (ABCU). The Computer Science department at ABCU needed a program that would help advisors efficiently access and manage course information. The application needed to support two main features:

  1. Display all Computer Science courses in alphanumeric order.

  2. Provide detailed course information, including title and prerequisites, for a course selected by the user.

üß† How did you approach the problem?

(Why are data structures important to understand?)

To solve the problem, I first created detailed pseudocode using three different data structures: Vector, Hash Table, and Binary Search Tree (BST). I explored how each could be used to store, organize, and retrieve course data.

After writing the pseudocode, I analyzed the performance of each structure in terms of search, insertion, and traversal time. This helped me choose the most efficient structure, a Binary Search Tree‚Äîfor implementing the final solution. Understanding how data structures influence performance was essential to building a fast and responsive program.

üõ†Ô∏è How did you overcome any roadblocks during the project?

When I ran into roadblocks, stepping back to refocus was key. I spent time making sure I understood the logic before diving into fixes. One big challenge came when implementing the Remove function in the hash table. I struggled to handle edge cases like removing the head node of a chain versus a node further down.

The code kept breaking, and it got frustrating. I took a break, then researched how other implementations handled the issue. Eventually, I realized I wasn‚Äôt tracking both the current and previous nodes correctly, which caused logic errors. Once I fixed that, the function worked as expected.

üß© How has this project expanded your approach to designing software?

Working on this project definitely expanded how I approach software design. This was my first real hands-on experience applying algorithms and data structures in code‚Äînot just learning them in theory. I realized how foundational these concepts are and how much I‚Äôll rely on them throughout my computer science degree and career.

Most importantly, I discovered just how powerful well-written pseudocode can be. It gave me a roadmap for each function and helped me catch logical issues before ever touching actual code.

üîß How has this project changed the way you write maintainable, readable, and adaptable code?

This project taught me that good code starts before you write a single line. Taking the time to plan things out with structured pseudocode not only made the final implementation easier‚Äîit made the codebase cleaner and more maintainable.

I also paid more attention to how I structured my functions and named my variables. I thought about how someone else (or future me) would read and understand the code later on. As a result, I now focus more on clarity, modularity, and scalability in my programs. This project didn‚Äôt just help me write better code, I feel it helped me to think more like a developer.
